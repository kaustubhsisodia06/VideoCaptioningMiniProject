# VideoCaptioningMiniProject
Understanding visual media, i.e. images and videos, has been a cornerstone topic
in computer vision research for a long time. Recently, a new task within the
purview of this research area, that of automatically captioning images and videos,
has garnered wide-spread interest. The task involves generating a short natural
language description of an image or a video.
We will take a look at an interesting multi model topic where we will combine both image and text processing to build a useful Deep Learning application, aka Image Captioning. Image Captioning refers to the process of generating textual description from an image â€“ based on the objects and actions in the image.
